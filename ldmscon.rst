  **If the file directory ``ldmscon2024`` is not extracted under ``/root/``** then please keep in mind that **any reference to ``/root/``** in the powerpoint presentation, and following files, **will need to be changed to ``<path-to-zip-files>/ldmscon2024/``**.

   * ``../conf/e3/agg_store_csv.conf``
   * ``../scripts/e1/start_ldms_simple.sh``
   * ``../scripts/e2/start_ldms_simple_agg.sh``
   * ``../scripts/e3/start_agg_store_csv.sh``
   * ``../scripts/e3/store_csv.txt``

.. note::
   * All files under ``../scripts/e*`` are not used in the tutorial but rather are the commands/steps used for each exercise. They demonstrate LDMS's ability to configure and initialize it's daemons with a single bash script.
