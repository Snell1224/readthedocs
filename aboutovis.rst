About the OVIS Project
================================
OVIS is composed of multiple subprojects, each designed to address specific aspects of HPC system monitoring and data management. These subprojects work together seamlessly to form a comprehensive ecosystem for efficient performance analysis and optimization.

### LDMS (Lightweight Distributed Metric Service)

LDMS is a lightweight framework for collecting, aggregating, and transporting system metrics in HPC environments. It gathers data from diverse sources like hardware counters and system logs, enabling real-time monitoring with low overhead and scalability for large systems.

### Maestro

Maestro manages data flow within the OVIS ecosystem, ensuring efficient transport, storage, and access. It integrates seamlessly with various data sources and sinks, maintaining high performance and low latency.

### SOS (Scalable Object Store)

SOS stores and queries observability data, acting as a repository for metrics and logs collected by LDMS. It supports advanced indexing and retrieval, enabling efficient exploration of large-scale datasets.

### Baler

Baler analyzes and compresses logs, extracting patterns and anomalies while reducing storage needs. It transforms raw logs into actionable insights, aiding trend detection and forensic analysis.
